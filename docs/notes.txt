Item definition for STB:
==========================
A switch is defined for set top box power key.
IP address 10.78.150.71 is running the Go-lang based binary for cmd2000 commands to the box.
This ip needs to be replaced with the IP of the PC where the G10-DVR box is connected through the dev hub.

The binary "host-remote" needs to be run on 8081 port.
host_remote binary needs to be gunzipped.

Following file => "<openHab-homedir>/conf/items/default.items" has items and groups defined for a house.

	Group H "House" <House> ["House"]
	Group Living "Living Room" <Living> (H) ["LivingRoom"]
	Group Bed "Bed Room" <Bed> (H) ["BedRoom"]

	//Switch Test "Test Switch" (Bed)

	Switch SetTopBox_Power "Cable Box Power" (Bed) ["Switchable"] { http=">[ON:PUT:http://10.78.150.71:8081/remote?stbip=10.10.1.27&remotekey=pwr] >[OFF:PUT:http://10.78.150.71:8081/remote?stbip=10.10.1.27&remotekey=g]" }
